            Kite is being developed by the effort of 3 career changers who have been experiencing the challenges of professional transitions first-hand.</p> 
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 p-6 text-center max-w-4xl">We are not alone, numbers pill up, many professionals who are switching jobs are also changing occupations.</p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 p-6 text-center max-w-4xl">We asked other career changers what they are missing, what they have tried, what worked and what didnâ€™t, and from that Kite started gaining shape.</p>
