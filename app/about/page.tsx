        Kite is being developed by the effort of 3 career changers who have been experiencing the challenges of professional transitions first-hand. We quickly realized we are not alone: many professionals are struggling to navigate career changes without clear guidance or support. We asked career changers what they are missing, what they have tried, from resources to bootcamps, mentoring, volunteer work, communities, what worked and what didnâ€™t.
